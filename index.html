        <p>“All that you touch you Change. All that you Change Changes you. The only lasting truth is Change. God is Change.”</p>
        <p class="quote-attribution">— Octavia Butler, Parable of the Sower</p>

        <p>“Hope is a discipline.”</p>

        <p>2020 has presented us with manifold challenges. Some of these challenges are centuries old, incited by the violence and atrocities of settler colonialism, industrialization, and the expansion of capitalism to all corners of the world. Some of these challenges feel new, but are the culmination of the terrifying effects of climate change threatening total ecological collapse. At every turn we are confronted with catastrophic situations, and we are called upon to find creative ways of sustaining, nourishing, and caring for our world.</p>

        <p>This reader was curated in response to the current situation we find ourselves in. It is informed by the life-altering events of COVID-19, the Black Lives Matter uprisings, the #landback movement, and global ecological emergency as the Western United States burns, the Gulf is decimated by hurricanes, & the Greenland ice sheet phases into a state of non-repair.</p>
